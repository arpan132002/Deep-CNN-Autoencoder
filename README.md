# Deep CNN Autoencoder

Welcome to the **Deep CNN Autoencoder** project! This repository contains the code and resources for building a deep convolutional neural network (CNN) autoencoder. The autoencoder is designed to learn efficient representations of data by encoding input data into a lower-dimensional space and then reconstructing it back to its original form.

## Features

- **Deep CNN Architecture**: Utilizes multiple convolutional layers for feature extraction and encoding.
- **Efficient Dimensionality Reduction**: Learns compressed representations of the input data.
- **Reconstruction Capability**: Reconstructs input data from its encoded representation.
- **Versatile Application**: Can be applied to various domains such as image compression, noise reduction, and anomaly detection.

### Requirements

- Python 3.x
- TensorFlow / Keras
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
